# 📘 CHANGELOG

## Version 1.0.0 – Course Module Implementation

### 🧩 Program Listing Page
- **Added dynamic API integration** using the `http` package to fetch paginated course data from a remote endpoint.  
- **Implemented JSON parsing** and data mapping into a custom `Course` model to manage structured content within the app.  
- **Introduced state management** using `setState()` to handle transitions between loading, success, and error states.  
- **Integrated loading indicator** using `SpinKitCubeGrid` from the `flutter_spinkit` package to enhance user feedback during data retrieval.  
- **Added error handling** with `try-catch` blocks and `SnackBar` notifications to manage network issues and API failures gracefully.  
- **Designed responsive UI components** for listing courses, including course title, summary, lecturer, and enrollment deadlines.  
- **Implemented pagination controls** (Next/Previous) to navigate through API pages dynamically.  
- **Enabled navigation** to detailed course pages (`ProgramDetails_Screen`) upon item selection for a smooth user flow.  

---

### 🧠 Program Details Screen
- **Connected detailed course view** to fetch individual course data dynamically using the course’s unique ID parameter.  
- **Enhanced state management** by maintaining loading states and real-time UI updates upon successful data fetch or failure.  
- **Reinforced error handling** with descriptive `SnackBar` alerts to provide user-friendly feedback during network or decoding errors.  
- **Integrated loading spinner (`SpinKitCubeGrid`)** for seamless user experience while awaiting data response.  
- **Implemented versatile image handling** that supports base64, remote URLs, and invalid image fallbacks, ensuring consistent visual presentation.  
- **Refined layout design** to display key course details such as title, instructor, summary, and enrollment deadline in a clear, structured format.  

---

### 📝 Course Registration Form
- **Introduced modal registration form** using `AlertDialog` for a non-intrusive and accessible user experience.  
- **Added form validation logic** leveraging `Form` and `TextFormField` validators to ensure accurate data entry for name, email, and phone fields.  
- **Implemented form submission workflow** with simulated API call delay (`Future.delayed`) to mimic real-world data posting.  
- **Integrated submission state feedback** with a `CircularProgressIndicator` to indicate ongoing form processing.  
- **Added success feedback mechanism** via a `SnackBar` message confirming enrollment submission and user acknowledgment.  
- **Ensured UI responsiveness and data consistency** through `GlobalKey<FormState>` management and proper form lifecycle control.  

---

### ⚙️ Overall Improvements
- Optimized **API-driven architecture** for dynamic content delivery.  
- Enhanced **user experience (UX)** with intuitive feedback loops and visual cues.  
- Improved **app reliability** through structured error management and robust state handling.  
- Ensured **UI consistency** across both listing and detail views with clean layout, modern color scheme, and responsive widgets.
